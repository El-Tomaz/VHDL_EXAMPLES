# VHDL EXAMPLES

Hello!! I'm Gabriel Tomaz, actually studying Eletrical Engineering at Instituto Federal da Para√≠ba.

This repo holds many vhdl code for different applications, and it's main pourpose is to track my learning.

for the simulation i'm using ghdl and gtk wave at ubuntu 24.02
In the future i may put some vhdl projects with real hardware.

My study method has the following steps:
- Study Digital Circuit themes (ex.: logic gates, multiplexers, etc...)
- Study VHDL syntax, resources and pratices
- Implement and test digital circuits learned in VHDL 

Tracking:
- 19/04/25: [Parity, Parity checker and generator]()
